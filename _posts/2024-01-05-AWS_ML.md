Artificial intelligence is the larger field of study using computers to do processes generally done by the human brain.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial inteilligence where we work on algorithms that are able to learn from a set of training data.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayer networks to build a model closer to a human brain.

All AI systems have three parts:
1) Training: supply training data to an algorithm
1) Model: Receive an output of the training process
1) Inference and hosting: use the model to make a prediction

All AWS services are exposed to each other via APIs that can be communicated via SDKs.

Amazon has a number of different ML services:
1) Amazon Rekognition: computer vision
1) Amazon Textract: automated text extraction and analysis
1) Amazon Comprehend: natural language processing
1) Amazon Transcribe: speech to text
1) Amazon Translate: machine langauge translation
1) Amazon Lex: chat bots and virtual agents
1) Amazon Sagemaker: build, train, and deploy your own machine learning models on managed infrastracture.
